# fusedrug.data

## interaction
* PyTorch dataset implementation for data as described in [DrugDiscoveryFoundationBenchmarks](https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/DrugDiscoveryFoundationBenchmarks).
* PyTorch dataset implementation for data in the style of [PyToDa](https://github.com/PaccMann/paccmann_datasets).

## molecule
* *fuse ops* and some basic utils related to small molecules.
* tokenizers for molecules

## ops
* a few general ops (will move to core *fuse* at some point)

## protein
* *fuse ops* and some basic utils related to proteins.

## tokenizer
* tokenizer for both protein and small-molecules tokenization
* *fuse ops* for applying huggingface/tokenizers, and PyToDa based tokenizers
